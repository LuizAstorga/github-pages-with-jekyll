# Luiz's First Blog for Funzies

  Today we started the day with the classic BIBLE! We got to go through a little bit of chapter 1 in ecclesiastes, second run through. Then I went right into some lecture watching. Unfortunately, it was pretty useless, typical, so we (dog just joined me) went into some note taking straight from the textbook. After that, we checked on the bois to see how the cold was treating them. They were doing gucci. We continued the grind by checking emails and doing some late assignments (that got pushed back bc the world is ending in Texas). Now i am here telling u my story of how i cam to christ. Thank you for listening to my ted talk :D
